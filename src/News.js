'During that same period, neonatal death rates increased one and six per cent respectively. Health experts believe that maternal and neonatal mortality rates had gone up due to the healthcare system being disrupted and less people visiting hospitals for child delivery.'
'This information was found after analysing child delivery, birth and neonatal death records at 586 hospitals under the management of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). Of the 586 government hospitals, there are 430 health complexes, 33 medical college hospitals and 123 district level hospitals of 10 to 250 beds.'
'Analysis of the DGHS data revealed, during the two years of high Covid prevalence, the rate of seeking maternity care had decreased by 10 to 18 per cent.However, the rate of availing service at hospitals has gone up again resulting in the decline in mortality rates this year.In comparison to 2019, maternal deaths have decreased by 19 per cent and neonatal deaths by 12 per cent in seven months starting from January to July of the current year.Physicians say, expectant mothers couldnt be provided proper maternity care at hospitals when during the the upward trend of Covid. Many pregnant women didnt even go to hospital for fear of contracting corona.Maternal and neonatal deaths rose due to various reasons like critical health condition caused by the lack of proper care prior to delivery, absence of medical care at hospitals while giving birth, or giving birth in unhygienic environments, infants being born with low birth weight and lack of proper neonatal care'
